    "Let's consider an application of the theory of elasticity. Whenever a force or a load is applied to a solid, the body deforms. Stress analysis relate loads and deformations. Elasticity theory deals with small (reversible) deformations, the body returns to its original size and shape when the load is removed. Within this range, the distances between atoms in the solid, or, alternatively, the atom–atom bonds, are stretched or compressed, but not broken. In order to remain in the elastic range, the fractional changes in interatomic distances (on a microscopic scale) or in the body’s gross dimensions (on a macroscopic scale) must be less than 0.2%. When loads or deformations exceed the elastic range, the changes in the shape of the body are not recovered when the load is removed. This type of irreversible deformation is defined plastic deformation. On a microscopic level, atomic bonds are broken and new bonds are formed. The maximum extent of plastic deformation is breakage or fracture of the material. Instead of load (or force) and deformation, elasticity theory utilizes the related quantities stress and strain. \n",

    "## Problem equations\n",
    "The equations governing small elastic deformations of a body $\\Omega$ can be written as\n",

Above we have assumed isotropic elastic conditions.\n",

    "Note that we could have written the PDE above as a single vector PDE for $u$, which is the governing PDE for the unknown $u$ (Navier's) equation. However, it is convenient to keep the current representation of the PDE for the derivation of the variational formulation.\n",

    "## The variational formulation\n",
    "The variational formulation of the PDE consists of forming the inner product of the PDE [](elasticity-PDE) with a *vector* test function $v\\in\\hat{V}$, where $\\hat{V}$ is a vector-valued test function space, and integrating over the domain $\\Omega$:\n",

    "```\n",
    "where the colon operator is the inner product between tensors (summed pairwise product of all elements), and $n$ is the outward unit normal at the boundary. The quantity $\\sigma \\cdot n$ is known as the *traction* or stress vector at the boundary, and often prescribed as a boundary condition. We here assume that it is prescribed on a part $\\partial \\Omega_T$ of the boundary as $\\sigma \\cdot n=T$. On the remaining part of the boundary, we assume that the value of the displacement is given as Dirichlet condition (and hence the boundary integral on those boundaries are $0$). We thus obtain\n",
